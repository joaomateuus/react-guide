# What are components ?
### When you have complex user interfaces its easier to break up this ui into pieces and separate the business logic into those pieces. And that's what are componentes UI pieces that we can put them together to build an user interface.

## Benefits Behind components:
* ### Reusability
    * Dont repeat yourself
* ### Separation of concerns
    * Don't do too many things in one and the same place (function)
<br>

## How is a component build ?
### React is a framework for build web user interfaces, and to create web frontend we just need:
* ### HTML
* ### CSS
* ### Javascript
### And that's how components are built in react. A component that has these 3 files that handle the layout structure (html), styling (css) and the dinamic (js).

## Declarative Approach
### With react we dont need to tell that certain html element should be created/inserted in certain place as we do with js writing all DOM instructions by our own. Instead we'll always define the desire end state and its react job to figure out wich element should be rendered
