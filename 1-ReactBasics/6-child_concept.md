# Props.children
### In React, props are used to pass data and functionality from one component to another. props.children is a special prop that allows you to pass children elements to a component that can be everything html, components, functions, objects and we`ll see the deep topics later but try to master html elements and components first. And this means you can compose and nest components in a more flexible and reusable way.

### Props.children is a powerful and versatile feature that is used extensively in React applications. It allows you to create highly reusable and composable components, which is one of the key advantages of React. By using props.children, you can build complex UIs by composing simple, reusable building blocks.
